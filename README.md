# Recession Analysis on Automotive Sales

## Project Overview
This project explores the impact of historical **economic recessions** on automobile sales, providing strategic insights to XYZ Automotives. As a data scientist hired by the company, the objective is to identify patterns, shifts in consumer behavior, and how vehicle categories performed during economic downturns.

The analysis is based on a simulated dataset, and visualizations are used to extract meaningful business insights that can inform marketing, production, and advertising decisions during uncertain economic times.

### Project Objectives
- Analyze automotive sales trends across recession and non-recession periods.
- Understand which vehicle types are most impacted during downturns.
- Evaluate advertising spend and its distribution across vehicle categories.
- Explore how macroeconomic factors like GDP and unemployment rate correlate with automotive sales.

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- JupyterLab for interactive development and visualization

### Data Overview
This project uses synthetic data that includes:
- Vehicle sales by year and category
- Recession periods flagged by year
- Advertising expenditures by vehicle type
- Macroeconomic indicators (GDP, unemployment)
- Seasonal effects (monthly data)

#### Key Recession Periods Analyzed:
- 1980
- 1981–1982
- 1991
- 2000–2001
- Late 2007 to Mid-2009 (Global Financial Crisis)
- 2020 (COVID-19 impact: Feb–April)

### Visualizations & Analysis
- Line Charts: Yearly sales trends and sales per vehicle category
- Bar Charts: Sales comparison between recession vs. non-recession years
- GDP Subplots: GDP movement across recession and stable periods
- Bubble Plot: Seasonality and its effect on monthly sales
- Scatter Plot: Correlation between vehicle price and sales volume
- Pie Charts:
  - Advertisement spend during recession vs. non-recession
  - Ad spend distribution by vehicle type during recessions
- Line Plot: Effect of unemployment rate on sales across vehicle types

### Key Findings
- Sports and executive vehicles experienced the most decline during recessions.
- Affordable vehicles like super minis and small family cars gained popularity.
- GDP decline strongly correlated with lower vehicle sales.
- Seasonality had minimal impact overall, but a spike in sales occurred in April.
- Advertising budgets were higher in stable periods, but during recessions, efforts shifted to lower-cost vehicles.
